# Atlas Obscura Roadtrip Planner

Small webapp that lets you find [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/) locations along a [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/) route. Still a work in progress, kinda.

# Context

I was roadtripping in California with my girlfriend. We used Atlas Obscura to find cool and unusual spots to visit. Unfortunately, Atlas Obscura's website isn't really made to plan a roadtrip. So I figured I'd fix that by mixing Google Maps Directions Services with the contents of Atlas Obscura's website.
